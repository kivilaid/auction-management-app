   - Real-time job status tracking
   - Retry failed extractions
   - Comprehensive job history

6. **Monitoring Dashboard** (`src/app/admin/monitoring/page.tsx`)
   - System performance metrics
   - Success/failure rate tracking
   - Data statistics visualization
   - Health alerts and notifications

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration

Add your OpenAI API key to `.env.local`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your-convex-deployment-url
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install openai @radix-ui/react-progress --legacy-peer-deps
```

### 3. Deploy Convex Schema

```bash
npx convex dev
```

This will deploy the new database schema including:
- `extractionJobs` table for job tracking
- `auctionImages` table for image metadata
- Extended `auctionSheets` table with comprehensive fields

### 4. Configure Cron Jobs

The system includes automated cron jobs for:
- Retrying failed extractions (every 30 minutes)
- Cleaning up old jobs (daily)

These are automatically deployed with your Convex functions.

## Usage Guide

### Manual Extraction

1. Navigate to **AI Extraction** in the admin interface
2. Enter the autoworldjapan.com auction URL
3. Provide authentication credentials
4. Set priority (1=low, 5=normal, 10=high)
5. Click "Schedule Extraction"

### Monitoring System Health

1. Navigate to **Monitoring** in the admin interface
2. View real-time system statistics
3. Monitor job success/failure rates
4. Track data extraction progress
5. Respond to system alerts

### Programmatic Usage

You can also schedule extractions programmatically using Server Actions:

```typescript
import { scheduleAuctionExtraction } from "@/lib/auctionActions";

const result = await scheduleAuctionExtraction(formData);
if (result.success) {
  console.log(`Job scheduled: ${result.jobId}`);
}
```

## Data Flow

```
1. User submits auction URL
   ‚Üì
2. Convex mutation creates extraction job
   ‚Üì
3. Convex action fetches authenticated HTML content
   ‚Üì
4. OpenAI GPT-5-mini extracts structured data
   ‚Üì
5. Auction sheet record created in database
   ‚Üì
6. Images downloaded and stored in Convex storage
   ‚Üì
7. Job marked as completed with metadata
```

## Supported Auction Data

### Vehicle Information
- Make, model, year, registration details
- Engine specifications (displacement, fuel type, engine code)
- Transmission details (type, speeds)
- Body specifications (doors, color, steering position)

### Condition Assessment
- Overall grade (S, 6, 5, 4.5, 4, 3.5, 3, 2, 1, 0, R, RA, ***)
- Exterior/Interior grades (A, B, C, D, E, F)
- Mileage with authenticity verification
- Comprehensive defect mapping by vehicle area

### Equipment & Features
- Standard equipment (AC, PS, PW, ABS, airbag, etc.)
- Advanced features (navigation, radar cruise, BSM, etc.)
- Custom equipment tracking

### Pricing & Auction Details
- Starting/reserve/average/final prices
- Auction house information
- Sale status and bidding details
- Export eligibility and fees

### Defect Documentation
- Area-specific defect codes (A1-A4, U1-U4, B1-B4, etc.)
- Defect severity and type classification
- Damage location mapping

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Automatic Retry Logic
- Failed jobs automatically retried up to 3 times
- 1-hour cooldown between retry attempts
- Exponential backoff for rate limiting

### Error Classification
